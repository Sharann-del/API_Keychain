## Overview

Modern apps want to use the generous free tiers from Gemini, Groq, Cerebras,
Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Together and Cohere. In practice that means a
different SDK and a different key for every provider, hand-rolled failover when
one of them returns a 429, and no shared view of what was used where.

API Keychain collapses all of that into one OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You send
a single keychain key and ask for an effort tier (`keychain-low`,
`keychain-medium` or `keychain-high`). The gateway builds an ordered cascade of
real models, tries them in priority order, skips anything that is throttled or
cooling down, and returns a clean OpenAI response. Every call is logged so the
dashboard can show request volume, token totals, success rate, latency and
per-provider health.

If your code already calls OpenAI, the only change is the base URL and the key.

## Highlights

| Capability | What it does |
| :-- | :-- |
| Effort-based routing | Request `low`, `medium` or `high`. The router cascades down a ranked model list until one answers, trading speed for quality on demand. |
| Automatic failover | A 429 or upstream outage transparently rolls to the next model, so the request still completes. |
| Rate-limit cooldowns | A provider that was just throttled is parked in a cooldown window and skipped until it recovers. |
| Encrypted at rest | Every upstream provider key is sealed with AES-256-GCM before it touches the database. |
| Bring your own models | Pin any model id a connected provider supports into a tier, then reorder its priority. |
| Usage analytics | Per-model and per-provider request counts, token totals, success rate, latency and daily volume. |
| Unified keychain key | One revealable `ak-` key fronts everything and can be rotated without touching upstream credentials. |
| OpenAI-compatible | Drop-in `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` for OpenAI SDKs and Chat Completions clients (Cursor, OpenCode, etc.). |

## How routing works

A single `keychain-high` request flows through the gateway like this:

1. The router expands the requested tier into an ordered cascade of model
   entries, highest priority first, honoring your enabled models, excluded
   models and preferred providers.
2. It walks the cascade. Any model whose provider is in a cooldown window, is
   excluded, or has no key is skipped.
3. The first model that returns a successful completion wins. Its response is
   normalized to the OpenAI schema and returned to the caller.
4. If a model returns a 429, its provider is marked for cooldown and the router
   continues to the next candidate.
5. The attempt, the serving model and provider, token usage, latency and status
   are written to the request log that powers the dashboard.

The result: one request in, automatic failover across providers, one clean
response out.

## Architecture

| Layer | Stack | Responsibility |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, SWR, Recharts | Marketing landing page, authentication, and the management dashboard. |
| Auth | Supabase (email and password) | Issues the JWT used to authorize management endpoints. |
| Gateway | FastAPI, httpx | OpenAI-compatible proxy, routing, failover, cooldowns and logging. |
| Storage | SQLAlchemy (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production) | Users, keychain keys, encrypted provider keys, model overrides, preferences, health and request logs. Supabase Postgres (or any Postgres) via `DATABASE_URL` on Render — the default SQLite file is ephemeral there and is wiped on redeploy. |
| Crypto | `cryptography` (AES-256-GCM) | Authenticated encryption of provider keys at rest. |

The frontend talks to the gateway over HTTP. Management calls carry the Supabase
JWT; inference calls carry the keychain `ak-` key as a bearer token, exactly as
an OpenAI client would.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

A recent Node.js (18 or newer), Python 3.10 or newer, and a Supabase project for
authentication.

### 1. Backend

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

export MASTER_SECRET="a-long-stable-secret"
export SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="your-supabase-legacy-jwt-secret"
export SUPABASE_URL="https://<project-ref>.supabase.co"

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The gateway listens on `http://localhost:8000`. Locally, SQLAlchemy defaults to
`keychain.db` in the project root. `MASTER_SECRET` must stay stable once set,
because it decrypts the provider keys already in the database.

For production persistence, set `DATABASE_URL` to PostgreSQL — see
[Installation → Database](docs/installation.md#database).

### 2. Frontend

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values
npm run dev
```

The dashboard runs on `http://localhost:3000` and points at the gateway through
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

## Configuration

The frontend reads the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables at build time. The backend reads
its own variables from the process environment (it does not load `.env.local`).

| Variable | Scope | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Frontend | Supabase project URL. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Frontend | Supabase anon / publishable key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` also works). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Frontend | Base URL of the gateway, without a trailing slash. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Frontend (server) | Same project URL; used by `@supabase/server` on Vercel. |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Frontend (server) | Publishable key for server-side Supabase helpers. |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Frontend (server) | Service-role key — server only, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. |
| `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL` | Frontend (server) | JWKS endpoint for JWT verification (optional if derived from `SUPABASE_URL`). |
| `MASTER_SECRET` | Backend | Encrypts stored provider keys with AES-256-GCM. Keep it stable. |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | Backend | Verifies Supabase JWTs on management endpoints (legacy HS256). |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Backend | Project URL; used to fetch JWKS for asymmetric JWT verification. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Backend | **Required on Render.** PostgreSQL connection string (`postgresql+psycopg2://…`). Omit locally to use SQLite. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Backend | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to call the gateway. Defaults include `http://localhost:3000`, `https://www.apikeychain.dev`, and `https://apikeychain.dev`. |

Full tables and examples: [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) and [.env.example](.env.example).

## Using the API

Point any **OpenAI Chat Completions** client at the gateway and select an effort
tier as the model (`keychain-low`, `keychain-medium`, or `keychain-high`).

**Compatibility note:** The gateway implements `POST /v1/chat/completions` and
`GET /v1/models` only. Tools that require other protocols need a different
endpoint or a translating proxy:

| Client | Protocol | Works with Keychain? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| OpenAI SDK, Cursor, OpenCode, curl | Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`) | Yes |
| OpenAI Codex CLI (2026+) | Responses API (`/v1/responses`) | No — use LiteLLM as a bridge, or Cursor/OpenCode |
| Claude Code | Anthropic Messages (`/v1/messages`) | No — use OpenRouter or an Anthropic-compatible gateway |

### Python

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="ak-your-keychain-key",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="keychain-high",  # keychain-low | keychain-medium | keychain-high
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum tunneling."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### TypeScript

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:8000/v1",
  apiKey: "ak-your-keychain-key",
});

const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "keychain-medium",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Draft a launch tweet." }],
});
```

### curl

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak-your-keychain-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "keychain-low",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Effort tiers

Each tier is an ordered cascade of real models. You can reorder, disable or
extend any of them from the dashboard.

| Tier | Pseudo-model | Best for | Example models in the cascade |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Low | `keychain-low` | Autocomplete, classification, high-volume calls | `gemini-2.0-flash`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant` |
| Medium | `keychain-medium` | Everyday chat and agents | `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `mistral-small-latest` |
| High | `keychain-high` | Frontier reasoning on hard problems | `gemini-2.5-pro`, `deepseek/deepseek-r1` |

## Supported providers

| Provider | Endpoint | Free models reachable |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Gemini | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | 10 |
| Groq | `api.groq.com` | 10 |
| Cerebras | `api.cerebras.ai` | 5 |
| Mistral | `api.mistral.ai` | 10 |
| DeepSeek | `api.deepseek.com` | 2 |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter.ai` | 12 |
| Together | `api.together.xyz` | 3 |
| Cohere | `api.cohere.ai` | 7 |

Every provider is OpenAI-compatible, so the gateway forwards a normalized
request and reads back a normalized response.

## API reference

Management endpoints are authorized with the Supabase JWT. Gateway endpoints are
authorized with the keychain `ak-` key. Public endpoints need no auth.

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `POST` | `/users/init` | JWT | Idempotently onboard the signed-in user. |
| `GET` `POST` | `/users/{id}/keychain-keys` | JWT | List or mint keychain keys. |
| `POST` | `/users/{id}/regenerate-key` | JWT | Rotate the primary keychain key. |
| `GET` `POST` `DELETE` | `/users/{id}/keys` | JWT | Manage encrypted provider keys. |
| `GET` `PUT` `POST` `DELETE` | `/users/{id}/models` | JWT | Enable, prioritize and extend models. |
| `GET` `PUT` | `/users/{id}/preferences` | JWT | Preferred and excluded providers and models. |
| `GET` | `/users/{id}/providers/health` | JWT | Per-provider status, cooldowns and counts. |
| `GET` | `/users/{id}/usage` | JWT | Aggregate usage and breakdowns. |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | Keychain key | OpenAI-compatible chat completions. |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | Keychain key | OpenAI-compatible model list. |
| `GET` | `/providers` `/models` `/health` | Public | Catalog and service health. |

## Security model

Provider keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using `MASTER_SECRET` before they
are stored, and are only decrypted in memory at request time to call upstream.
The dashboard never receives a raw provider key back. The keychain `ak-` key is
shown once on creation and stored masked thereafter, and can be rotated at any
time, which immediately invalidates the previous key. Management endpoints
verify the Supabase JWT (both legacy HS256 and asymmetric signing keys via the
project JWKS), and every gateway request is scoped to the owning user.

## Deployment

Reference production URLs:

| Component | URL |
| :-- | :-- |
| Dashboard | `https://www.apikeychain.dev` |
| Gateway | `https://api.apikeychain.dev` |

**Dashboard (Vercel)** — standard Next.js deploy. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (must be the
public gateway URL, not `localhost`). Optionally set server-only Supabase vars
for `@supabase/server` — see [Installation](docs/installation.md).

**Gateway (Render, Railway, Fly, etc.)** — run `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`.
On Render, set `PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.8`. Required secrets: `MASTER_SECRET`,
`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_URL`. Set `CORS_ORIGINS` if you add custom domains.

**Database (critical on Render):** Render's filesystem is ephemeral. Without
`DATABASE_URL`, SQLite is deleted on every deploy. Use Supabase Postgres (session
pooler URI, `postgresql+psycopg2://…`) or another hosted Postgres. Tables are
created automatically on startup. Step-by-step:
[Installation → Database](docs/installation.md#database).

**Supabase auth URLs:** Site URL `https://www.apikeychain.dev`, redirect
`https://www.apikeychain.dev/auth/callback` — needed for email confirmation
and password reset. Add `https://apikeychain.dev/**` if the apex domain also
serves the dashboard.
